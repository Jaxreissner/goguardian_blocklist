> 🧠 **tips:**
> - to test if your blocklist is active, try blocking a random site like `homedepot.com`. if it stops loading, your setup is working ✅  
> - use **[AdGuard DNS](https://adguard-dns.io)** or **[NextDNS](https://nextdns.io)** to apply this blocklist network-wide across your devices. you can add these domains manually in their filtering settings for extra control.  
> - blocklists aren't "set it and forget it" — **GoGuardian is always evolving**, so make sure to check your **DNS logs** regularly (on AdGuard or NextDNS) to find and block **new goguardian domains** they might sneak in with 🕵️‍♀️

> 🔐 **extra:** some systems allow wildcards like `*.goguardian.com` — use that for max blocking power if your blocker supports it.
